                                            <h3>English Department</h3>
                                            
                                            <p>The English department aims to achieve a balance between equipping pupils with practical skills, and giving students enthusiasm for language and literature that will provide lifelong pleasure. English teaching at all levels takes into account the international nature of the school and aims to satisfy the needs of individual pupils.</p>
                                            <p>In the first years, Kindergarten to Year 3, English is taught by class teachers, with the aim of providing communicative competence in listening and speaking, accurate writing of small units of language, and knowledge of the elements of grammar and punctuation. The enjoyment of reading is also encouraged.</p>
                                            <p>English is taught as a specialist subject from Year 4 onwards. A reading text for each term, forms the basis for developing skills in both language and literature. The texts are supplemented by shorter works, short stories, poetry, and plays. Students undertake a variety of tasks which practise skills required for the IGCSE level examination. Computer based skills are also encouraged through the use of the Internet and word processing.</p>
                                            <p>In Year 10 and Year 11 English Language and English Literature are taken separately, with Literature an option. The Language course is based on the objectives of the IGCSE level papers: accurate and discerning reading; controlled writing in a variety of modes; writing to suit a variety of forms, audiences and purposes. Overall the development of language skills is the central objective. English Literature is also an IGCSE course and comprises close study and critical analysis of poetry, prose, and drama. Development of analytical skills, essay writing and awareness of social-historical contexts form the basis of this study.</p>
                                            <p>At 'A' level, English Literature is offered as a modular course in which two modules may be completed in the first year and two in the second. The work comprises close study of texts, with analysis and commentary using techniques of literary criticism, and also detailed critical study of extracts from a variety of forms of prose and poetry. Normally eight texts are studied from a range of periods and national and cultural origins. Wide reading outside the texts is required, and students are encouraged to attend live drama performances, watch films of plays, and immerse themselves in a literary milieu. Extensive analytical writing is required, an interpretation of a range of texts, and an understanding how historical -cultural contexts shape literature . 'A' level English Literature can lead to further study and courses in: literature, law, journalism, media studies, and publishing.</p>


                                            <h3>French Department</h3> 

                                            <p>French is taught to all pupils up to Year 11. In the Preparatory School, pupils start French in Year 1 where the emphasis is on conversation. The children learn how to introduce themselves and give each other personal information. In Year 4 and 5 basic grammar is introduced and pupils start acquiring vocabulary. A balance is kept between speaking, listening and writing, with one lesson per week devoted to conversation. Poems, songs and games are used to reinforce the language and make learning fun. </p>
                                            <p>In the Senior School, pupils have four French lessons per week and now the emphasis changes as the key to success in examination lies in a secure knowledge of grammar. In Years 7, 8 and 9 pupils are given a good working knowledge of basic sentence structures and the main grammatical features of the language. Conversation plays a vital part in language learning as students have to prepare for I.G.C.S.E exams in Year 11. They are required to write formal and informal letters and read newspaper articles and signs used in everyday life in France.</p>
                                            <p>With the I.G.C.S.E we hope to make the learning of the language more practical and this will enable the students to cope in any situation. In the 6th Form, French can be studied at 'A' level. During the two year course, students are introduced to a wide range of language skills as the final examination consists of six modules. French can also be studied at 'AS' level.</p>


                                            <h3>Mathematics Department</h3>

                                            <p>Mathematics is a compulsory subject for all pupils up to 'O' Level. We follow the University of London's Mathematics syllabus B, which brings together the 'modern' and 'traditional' approaches to 'O' Level mathematics. The emphasis of the syllabus is more on understanding and application of concepts, rather than on mechanical solutions of problems.</p>
                                            <p>We also offer Additional Mathematics for pupils in Year 10 whose competence may have developed early. This course assumes knowledge of the topics contained in the syllabus for the ordinary Mathematics 'O' Level and extends the content of the course.</p>
                                            <p>At 'A' Level the school offers Pure Mathematics which includes Algebra, Vectors, Calculus, Trigonometry, Complex Numbers, Functions, Approximation and Differential Equations. Other modules may be possible, depending on the size of the 'A' Level class. The course is intended for both the Mathematics specialist and those who need it for courses in Engineering or Technology, and it may be studied in combination with any other subjects. Success in the subject requires both ability and motivation and we recommend that students should have gained grade A or B in their 'O' Level and at least grade C in Additional Mathematics, if taken. The course is modular and all pupils are required to sit for 'A/S' level Mathematics in Year 12 and then proceed with the remaining modules in Year 13.</p>

                                            <h3>Geography Department</h3>

                                            <p>In the Preparatory department, Geography is taught in conjunction with other subjects, on a thematic basis. For instance, pupils study Tropical Rain Forests and Polar Regions. They also investigate the physical and human features of their surroundings, The Coast Province.</p>
                                            <p>Pupils in Years 5 and 6 investigate the physical geography of Kenya, develop their map skills and develop their ability to recognise patterns by studying agricultural patterns, the weather and patterns of land use in a settlement.</p>
                                            <p>In Year 7 pupils study a broad variety of topics designed to give a solid foundation upon which to base further studies towards G.C.E 'O' level Geography. They study physical processes that change the environment like weathering, erosion and deposition. They also study Human activities such as farming and industries and their impact on the environment.</p>
                                            <p>In Year 8 pupils study Human, Physical and |Environmental topics. They include weather and climate, ecosystems, soil erosion, global warming, volcanoes and earthquakes, and human geography of Kenya. They also do map reading skills.</p>
                                            <p>In Year 9 the subject is still compulsory for all pupils, who begin to follow the G.C.E 'O' level course, and in Year 10 it may be chosen as an option to be continued to examination level. All topics are taught in strict conformity with the University of London G.C.E syllabus. In Year 9 pupils focus on Global Economic Activities and Environmental Issues. In Years 10 and 11, the core of Physical Geography, namely Geomorphology and Climatology is developed, and at the same time the practical aspects of Cartography and Fieldwork are encouraged. The Human aspects of Geography are also covered in these years, Development Issues and Population stressing the contrasts between developed and developing countries by focusing on a broad range of case studies.</p>
                                            <p>Geography is also offered as an 'A' level subject, covering a broad range of modules. The syllabus enables students to acquire: an in-depth knowledge and understanding of the nature and functioning of selected physical and human environments at a range of scales; an understanding of the inter-relationships and interactions between and within the physical and human environments; a range of practical skills to support and enhance their geographical knowledge and understanding.</p>

                                            <h3>Science Department</h3><br>

                                            <h4>General Science</h4>

                                            <p>Science is taught as theme topics in Junior School. Pupils begin their General Science course in Year 3. This is an integrated course covering aspects of Chemistry, Physics and Biology. Much emphasis is placed on developing an investigative approach and application of Science to everyday life, utilising the well-equipped science laboratories. Our aim is to foster a keen interest in all sciences by providing a sound basis of knowledge besides trying to ensure enjoyment of the topics covered. The General Science course culminates in the Edexcel Primary Curriculum Science Examination, in Year 6.</p>

                                            <h4>Biology</h4>

                                            <p>After studying the subject as part of a General Science course in the Preparatory School, all pupils are introduced to Biology as a separate subject in Year 7. For two years, pupils will study a broad variety of topics designed to give a solid foundation upon which to base further studies towards I.G.C.S.C</p>
                                            <p>In Year 9 the subject is still compulsory for all pupils, who begin to follow the G.C.E 'O' level course and in Year 10 it may be chosen as an option to be continued to examination level. In all Years much emphasis is given to practical work and first-hand observation in the laboratory, and field work on organised trips to the local Nature Trail, Fish Farm, and Botanical Gardens.</p>
                                            <p>Biology is offered at 'A' level, using the same examination board. Modern modular syllabuses with their emphasis on practical observation, hypothesis formation and experimental procedure in such areas as biochemistry, physiology, biotechnology and molecular biology ensure that an 'A' level pass is a suitable and worthwhile qualification for most higher education and industrial courses.</p>
                                            <p>Such syllabuses also require a full understanding of ecology and principles of conservation of our environment and its natural resources. It is therefore expected that all Sixth Form students will participate in organised field study work</p>
                                            <p>After 'A' level, students may proceed to University to take degrees in Biological Sciences, Medicine, Biotechnology and other related subjects</p>

                                            <h4>Chemistry</h4>

                                            <p>Chemistry is taken by all pupils in Years 7, 8, and 9. This introductory course has been designed to include all the practical skills, concepts and knowledge in accordance with Attainment Targets 1 and 3 of the Science National Curriculum. It is context-based and there is an emphasis on application so that a better understanding of Chemistry and its importance to modern society is achieved. These themes are developed in Year 9 when all pupils start the I.G.C.S.E 'O' level syllabus</p>
                                            <p>In Years 10 and 11, Chemistry may be chosen as an optional subject. The Syllabus is designed to be flexible enough to be an excellent preparation for those who wish to study Chemistry at a higher level but also to cater for those who cease studying it at 16.</p>
                                            <p>At 6th Form level, Chemistry is a popular 'A' level choice for students preparing for university entry in Medicine, Veterinary Science, Dentistry, Engineering and Pure and Applied Science. Students are taught in small groups and extensive use is made of the well equipped Chemistry laboratory.</p>

                                            <h4>Physics</h4>

                                            <p>Physics is compulsory from Years 7-9 and during this time a broad introduction to the subject is given. One aim of this is to provide those students who choose to follow Physics in Year 10 and 11 with a firm foundation and to provide an insight into the place of Physics in the modern world.</p>
                                            <p>The 'O' level course, followed in Years 10 and 11, gives a detailed and comprehensive coverage of the subject that is an excellent preparation for 'A' level, as well as providing useful skills for those leaving the subject at 16.</p>
                                            <p>The school has two well equipped modern Physics laboratories, and practical work is an important part of the course. It is used to reinforce theoretical lessons and to increase both enjoyment and understanding of the subject.</p>

                                            <h3>Computer Studies</h3>

                                            <p>The Computer Studies department is committed to ensuring that all our students become highly confident and competent in the use of computers. As well as taking the form of a subject in its own right, the computer facilities at the school are increasingly being used to enhance learning right across the school curriculum from the kindergarten to A Levels.</p>
                                            <p>The practical skills in using the computer begin at the Junior Level in Year 1. Initiating them from using the mouse control to eventually opening files and saving files, the students are gradually taken forward. Creativity is enhanced at this level with less formal tasks</p>
                                            <p>In the preparatory school ICT becomes a bit more formal with introduction of Microsoft Office software to the students. As the students progress through prep years, the foundation is laid for work in all areas.</p>
                                            <p>Students in senior school develop the most up-to-date, commercially-relevant skills in a range of computer software applications, including word processing, spreadsheet, database, multimedia presentation, desktop publishing, computer-aided graphic design, web site design, simulation, statistical modelling and communication packages. Students are encouraged to make constructive use of the Internet for research and communication.</p>

                                            <h3>History Department</h3>

                                            <p>The History Department aims to develop in every student an interest in and an understanding of the past. Throughout each year students develop important skills including the ability to analyse sources, understand attitudes in the past, construct a coherent argument, discuss and debate. Students are also required to develop research skills and carry out their own historical enquiries. Students are encouraged to develop their own ideas and communicate them in a reasoned, organised way.</p>
                                            <p>In the Preparatory school, Year 4 focuses on a study of Ancient Egypt and Ancient Greece. In Year 5 the Romans, Anglo-Saxons and Vikings are studied. A course on Medicine through time enables students to develop a clearer sense of chronology and begin to consider the concepts of change and continuity. In Year 6 the East African Coast, the Expansion of Islam and Medieval Europe are studied. Lower down in the Preparatory school, History is taught in conjunction with other subjects as part of Topic.</p>
                                            <p>In the Secondary school, Year 7 studies the Industrial Revolution and undertakes an in-depth study of the Slave Trade. In Year 8, students investigate the French Revolution, Napoleon and the Black Peoples of the Americas. In Year 9 students examine World War 1 and some of its consequences.</p>
                                            <p>History is taken as an option at I.G.C.S.E and the syllabus is started in Year 9. Edexel's I.G.C.S.E History Syllabus A is studied which focuses on Modern World History. History is also available as an option at 'A' level.</p>

                                            <h3>Business Studies</h3>

                                            <p>Business Studies is offered at 'A' level and runs as a modular programme. It is essential that a student considering taking Business Studies should have a sound grounding in Mathematics and English. A genuine interest in national and international business is also essential. 'O' level Economics provides a helpful background to 'A' level Business but is not a prerequisite for entry to the course</p>

                                            <h3>Economics</h3>

                                            <p>Economics is offered as an option at both IGCSE 'O' and 'A' levels.</p>
                                            <p>'O' level Economics provides a good introduction to the 'A' Level course, although it is not essential to the capable student wanting to take the 'A' level.</p>
                                            <p>Human beings face economic choices on a daily basis as we attempt to solve the economic problems of limited resources and unlimited wants. Economics looks at the way society organises itself to address the problem.</p>
                                            <p>The 'O' level course gives students an introduction to the subject which, even if not studied further, will equip them to understand the basic economic issues discussed by the media.</p>
                                            <p>Economics is offered at 'A' level, combining the methodical approach of the Sciences with the study of practical economic issues of the day.</p>
                                            <p>The 'A' level programme takes up the same themes studied at 'O' level but considers them much more rigorously. Applied Economics, studying the economic performance of the U.K and Kenyan Governments, provides an invigorating course for students who want to master the economic intricacies of developed and developing countries.</p>
                                            <p>Such stimulating topics include among others, the study of industry, the price mechanism, international trade and finance, multinationals, inflation, employment, government policy and the developing world.</p>
                                            <p>'A' level Economics is widely respected by universities and employers as an excellent qualification.</p>

                                            <h3>Music Department</h3>

                                            <p>Music is included in the weekly timetable from Kindergarten through to Year 8. The department aims to promote enjoyment, awareness and understanding of a wide range of music, both 'classical' and 'popular', from around the world, as well as to develop each child's own musical skills and confidence. Singing and practical music-making form a large part of the curriculum.</p>
                                            <p>A variety of extra-curricular activities are on offer to students in Years 1 to 13, and the Academy presents several concerts each year, in which students of all ages are encouraged to take part.</p>
                                            <p>The school has its own Band and choir singing has recently found its way in the department as co-curricular activity. Besides regular classes extra lessons are organised for Recorder, Guitar and Keyboard.</p>

                                            <h3>Physical Education</h3>

                                            <p>Physical Education is an important and busy part of the pupils' lives. Curriculum time is split into three sections: Swimming, Games and Physical Education and all children gain access to a wide and varied programme of activities during the course of each academic year.</p>
                                            <p>Specialist Physical Education starts when the children are 5 years old (Year 1) and continues until they finish their schooling, at either 16 or 18 years of age. The philosophy of the department's approach is one of mixed ability teaching so that all pupils, regardless of their differing strengths and abilities, will gain experience in as wide a range of sports as possible. They are also encouraged to believe in the benefits of physical activity of all kinds, so that they can pursue an active lifestyle when they leave school.</p>
                                            <p>The organisation of the curriculum is based broadly on the English school system. In swimming, pupils remain with their class until Year 8. Thereafter, they are split according to gender to pursue more specialised swimming activities. Their Games lessons are split by gender to follow appropriate sporting specialism, and their Physical Education lessons are all mixed to allow for further group interaction. From Year 1 to 2 the emphasis is on the child's cognitive development, both in and out of water. From a broad range of activities designed to improve co-ordination in Motor skills, we hope to provide the children with the necessary skill base to then move on to more specific sporting activities.</p>
                                            <p>In Year 3 those specialization begins. In swimming, pupils will experience activities including stroke improvement, personal survival, life-saving, water polo, synchronised swimming and diving. In Physical Education and Games, the pupils will have access to gymnastics, volleyball, health related fitness, tennis, athletics, cricket, rounders, soccer, rugby, basketball, hockey, netball, squash, badminton, dance, and outdoor education.</p>
                                            <p>Pupils also have the opportunity to compete in a lively House System over a wide range of sporting activities and may then go on to represent the school in fixtures against other schools. Traditionally, the school has always had a very good swimming team and is generally regarded as one of the strongest teams in Kenya. The school also competes in rugby, soccer, basketball, volleyball, netball, squash, hockey, rounders and badminton. These fixtures often require trips to Nairobi to compete with schools there.</p>
